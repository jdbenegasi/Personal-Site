		<h1 class="name"> About Me</h1>
		<p class="aboutmetext">
			I am a ninteen year old self taught web developer. I first realized my love for programming and computers in my freshman year of highschool when I took two computer related classes. Operating systems and Java I also took a web development class that taught me the basics of Adobe Dreamweaver. I am currently enrolled in college at Robert Morris University in Moon twp. Pennsylvania. I love programming because it gives people a wide range of ways to solve a problem, in other words there is no right or wrong way to solve a problem. I am dedicated to constantly learning new and more efficent skillsets that will allow me to write better code. My website will always be under development. As I learn more new and exciting skills I will showcase them on my site.
